# **Lab 08-Develop, evaluate, and score a forecasting model for superstore sales**
**Introduction**

In this lab, you'll see Microsoft Fabric's end-to-end data science
workflow for a forecasting model. This scenario uses the historic sales
data to predict the sales for different categories of products at a
superstore.

Forecasting is a crucial asset in sales, harnessing historical data and
predictive methods to provide insights into future trends. By analyzing
past sales, identifying patterns, and learning from consumer behavior,
businesses can optimize inventory, production, and marketing strategies.
This proactive approach enhances adaptability, responsiveness, and
overall performance of businesses in a dynamic marketplace.

**Objective**

1.  Load the data

2.  Understand and process the data using exploratory data analysis

3.  Train a machine learning model using an open source software package
    called SARIMAX and track experiments using MLflow and Fabric
    Autologging feature

4.  Save the final machine learning model and make predictions

5.  Demonstrate the model performance via visualizations in Power BI

    develop a model to forecast the sales on a monthly basis, you need
    to resample on the column Order Date.

8.  First, group the Furniture category by Order Date and then calculate
    the sum of the Sales column for each group in order to determine the
    total sales for each unique Order Date. Then, resample
    the Sales column using the MS frequency to aggregate the data by
    month and then you calculate the mean sales value for each month.

9.  Select the code cell and click on the **play** button to execute

13. A time series tracks four data elements at set intervals in order to
    determine the variation of those four elements in the time series
    pattern. These elements include:

- **Level:** Refers to the fundamental component that represents the
  average value for a specific time period.

- **Trend:** Describes whether the time series is decreasing, constant,
  or increasing over time.

- **Seasonality:** Describes the periodic signal in the time series and
  looks for cyclic occurrences that affect the time series' increasing
  or decreasing patterns.

- **Noise/Residual:** Refers to the random fluctuations and variability
  in the time series data that cannot be explained by the model.

## Task 3: Model Training and Tracking

With your data in place, you can define the forecasting model. Apply the
Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous
regressors (SARIMAX) in this notebook. SARIMAX is a time series
forecasting model that extends SARIMA to include exogenous variables. It
combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components,
seasonal differencing, and external predictors to make accurate and
flexible forecasts for time series data, making it a powerful tool for
various forecasting tasks.

1.  Use MLfLow and Fabric Autologging to track the experiments. Here
    you'll load the delta table from the lakehouse. You may use other
    delta tables considering the lakehouse as the source. Select the
    code cell and click on the **play** button to execute cell.

     ![](./media/image29.png)
2.  SARIMAX takes into account the parameters involved in regular ARIMA
    mode (p,d,q) and also adds the seasonality parameters (P,D,Q,s).
    These arguments to SARIMAX model are called order (p,d,q) and
    seasonal order (P,D,Q,s) respectively and hence 7 parameters to
    tune. Prior to model training, you need to set up these parameters
    which are defined in the following.

3.  Select the code cell and click on the **play** button to execute
    cell.

4.  To model training, select the code cell and click on the **play**
    button to execute cell.

      ![](./media/image32.png)
5.  Visualize a time series forecast for furniture sales data, showing
    both the observed data and the one-step-ahead forecast with a
    confidence interval shaded region. Select the code cell and click on
    the **play** button to execute cell.

      ![](./media/image34.png)

      ![](./media/image35.png)

6.  Note that predictions is utilized to assess the model's performance
    by contrasting it with the actual values,
    whereas **predictions_future** is indicative of future forecasting.

7.  Select the code cell and click on the **play** button to execute
    cell.

     ![](./media/image36.png)

     ![](./media/image37.png)

## Task 4: Score the model and save predictions

1.  The actual values are integrated with the forecasted values, which
    will be employed to create the Power BI report. Note that these
    results will be stored into a table within the lakehouse.

2.  Select the code cell and click on the **play** button to execute
    cell.

     ![](./media/image38.png)

     ![](./media/image39.png)

## **Task 5: Business Intelligence via Visualizations in Power BI**

The Power BI report shows the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of
16.58. MAPE is a metric that defines the accuracy of a forecasting
method and represents how accurate the forecasted quantities are in
comparison with the actual quantities. MAPE is a straightforward metric,
with a 10% MAPE representing that the average deviation between the
forecasted values and actual values was 10%, regardless of whether the
deviation was positive or negative. Note that what one considers to be a
desirable MAPE value varies across different industries.

The light blue line in the graph represents the actual sales values,
while the dark blue line represents the forecasted sales values. An
analysis of the comparison between the actual and forecasted sales
reveals that the model effectively predicts sales for the Furniture
category during the first six months of 2023.

Based on this observation, it is justifiable to have confidence in the
model's forecasting capabilities for the overall sales in the last six
months of 2023 and extending into 2024. This confidence can inform
strategic decisions regarding inventory management, raw material
procurement, and other business-related considerations.
