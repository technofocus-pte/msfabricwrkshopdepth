# **Lab 04 - Creating and using a Dataflow (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric**

**Introduction**

In Microsoft Fabric, Dataflows (Gen2) connect to various data sources
and perform transformations in Power Query Online. They can then be used
in Data Pipelines to ingest data into a lakehouse or other analytical
store, or to define a dataset for a Power BI report.

This lab is designed to introduce the different elements of Dataflows
(Gen2), and not create a complex solution that may exist in an
enterprise.

**Objectives**:

- Establish a data lakehouse in the Data Engineering experience and
  ingest relevant data for subsequent analysis.

- Define a dataflow for extracting, transforming, and loading data into
  the lakehouse.

- Configure data destinations within Power Query to store the
  transformed data in the lakehouse.

- Incorporate the dataflow into a pipeline to enable scheduled data
  processing and ingestion.

- Remove the workspace and associated elements to conclude the exercise.

# Exercise 1: Create a Dataflow (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric

In Microsoft Fabric, Dataflows (Gen2) connect to various data sources
and perform transformations in Power Query Online. They can then be used
in Data Pipelines to ingest data into a lakehouse or other analytical
store, or to define a dataset for a Power BI report.

This exercise is designed to introduce the different elements of
Dataflows (Gen2), and not create a complex solution that may exist in an
enterprise

## Task 1: Create a Dataflow (Gen2) to ingest data

Now that you have a lakehouse, you need to ingest some data into it. One
way to do this is to define a dataflow that encapsulates an *extract,
transform, and load* (ETL) process.

1.  Now, click on **Fabric_lakehouse** on the left-sided navigation
    pane.

     ![](./media/image125.png)

10.  Set the New column name to +++MonthNo+++ , set the Data type to
    **Whole Number** and then add the following
    formula:+++Date.Month([OrderDate])+++ under **Custom column
    formula**. Select **OK**.

      ![](./media/image126.png)

11. Notice how the step to add the custom column is added to the query.
    The resulting column is displayed in the data pane.

      ![](./media/image127.png)

    **Tip:** In the Query Settings pane on the right side, notice
    the **Applied Steps** include each transformation step. At the bottom,
    you can also toggle the **Diagram flow** button to turn on the Visual
    Diagram of the steps.
    
    Steps can be moved up or down, edited by selecting the gear icon, and
    you can select each step to see the transformations apply in the preview
    pane.

#**Task 2: Add data destination for Dataflow**

## Task 3: Add a dataflow to a pipeline

You can include a dataflow as an activity in a pipeline. Pipelines are
used to orchestrate data ingestion and processing activities, enabling
you to combine dataflows with other kinds of operation in a single,
scheduled process. Pipelines can be created in a few different
experiences, including Data Factory experience.

1.  In the Synapse Data Engineering Home page , Under **dp_FabricXX**
    pane, select **+New item** -\> **Data pipeline**

      ![](./media/new17.png)

2.  In the **New pipeline** dialog box, enter **Load data** in
    the **Name** field, click on the **Create** button to open the new
    pipeline.

     ![](./media/image144.png)

3.  The pipeline editor opens.

      ![](./media/image145.png)

     **Tip**: If the Copy Data wizard opens automatically, close it!

4.  Select **Pipeline activity**, and add a **Dataflow** activity to the
    pipeline.

      ![](./media/image146.png)

5.  With the new **Dataflow1** activity selected, on
    the **Settings** tab, in the **Dataflow** drop-down list,
    select **Gen2_Dataflow** (the data flow you created previously)

      ![](./media/image147.png)

6.  On the **Home** tab, save the pipeline using the **🖫 (*Save*)**
    icon.

      ![](./media/image148.png)

7.  Use the **▷ Run** button to run the pipeline, and wait for it to
    complete. It may take a few minutes.

      ![](./media/image149.png)

       ![](./media/image150.png)

      ![](./media/image151.png)

8.  In the menu bar on the left edge, select your workspace i.e
    **dp_FabricXX**.

      ![](./media/image152.png)

9.  In the **Fabric_lakehouse** pane, select the
    **Gen2_FabricLakehouse** of type Lakehouse.

      ![](./media/image153.png)

10. In **Explorer** pane, select the **…** menu for **Tables**,
    select **refresh**. Then expand **Tables** and select
    the **orders** table, which has been created by your dataflow.

     ![](./media/image155.png)

**Tip**: Use the Power BI Desktop *Dataflows connector* to connect
directly to the data transformations done with your dataflow.

You can also make additional transformations, publish as a new dataset,
and distribute with intended audience for specialized datasets.

## Task 4: Clean up resources

In this exercise, you’ve learned how to use Spark to work with data in
Microsoft Fabric.

If you’ve finished exploring your lakehouse, you can delete the
workspace you created for this exercise.

1.  In the bar on the left, select the icon for your workspace to view
    all of the items it contains.

      ![](./media/image156.png)
