# **Lab 07- Implementing a Data Science scenario in Microsoft Fabric** 
**Introduction**

The lifecycle of a Data science project typically includes (often,
iteratively) the following steps:

- Business understanding

- Data acquisition

- Data exploration, cleansing, preparation, and visualization

- Model training and experiment tracking

- Model scoring and generating insights.

The goals and success criteria of each stage depend on collaboration,
data sharing and documentation. The Fabric data science experience
consists of multiple native-built features that enable collaboration,
data acquisition, sharing, and consumption in a seamless way.

In these tutorials, you take the role of a data scientist who has been
given the task to explore, clean, and transform a dataset containing the
churn status of 10000 customers at a bank. You then build a machine
learning model to predict which bank customers are likely to leave.

**Objective**

1.  Use the Fabric notebooks for data science scenarios.

2.  Ingest data into a Fabric lakehouse using Apache Spark.

3.  Load existing data from the lakehouse delta tables.

4.  Clean and transform data using Apache Spark and Python based tools.

5.  Create experiments and runs to train different machine learning
    models.

6.  Register and track trained models using MLflow and the Fabric UI.

7.  Run scoring at scale and save predictions and inference results to
    the lakehouse.

8.  Visualize predictions in Power BI using DirectLake.

## Task 1: Create a workspace 

Before working with data in Fabric, create a workspace with the Fabric
trial enabled.

    ![](./media/image10.png)
 
    ![](./media/image11.png)

9.  Wait for the deployment to complete. It takes 2-3 minutes to
    complete. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty.

## Task 2: Create a lakehouse and upload files

Now that you have a workspace, it’s time to switch to the **Data
engineering** experience in the portal and create a data lakehouse for
the data files you’re going to analyze.

1.  At the bottom left of the Power BI portal, select the **Power
    BI** icon and switch to the **Data Engineering** experience.

2.  In the **Synapse Data Engineering** home page, Select
    **Lakehouse(Preview)** under **New** pane.

      ![](./media/image12.png)

3.  In the **New lakehouse** dialog box, enter
    **+++FabricData_Sciencelakehouse+++** in the **Name** field, click on the
    **Create** button and open the new lakehouse.

      ![](./media/image14.png)

4.  After a minute or so, a new empty lakehouse will be created. You
    need to ingest some data into the data lakehouse for analysis.

      ![](./media/image15.png)

5.  You will see a notification stating **Successfully created SQL
    endpoint**.

     ![](./media/image16.png)

5.  On the Data-ScienceXX workspace homepage, select the
    **1-ingest-data** notebook.

     ![](./media/image23.png)

6.  If the imported notebook includes output, select the **Edit** menu,
    then select **Clear all outputs**.

     ![](./media/image24.png)

## **Task 4: Attach a lakehouse to the notebooks**

To demonstrate Fabric lakehouse features, many of the tutorials require
attaching a default lakehouse to the notebooks. The following steps show
how to add an existing lakehouse to a notebook in a Fabric-enabled
workspace.

1.  Select **Add lakehouse** in the left pane and select **Existing
    lakehouse** to open the **Data hub** dialog box.

     ![](./media/image25.png)

2.  In the **Add lakehouse** box, select the **Existing
    lakehouse** radio button and click on the **Add** button.

      ![](./media/image26.png)

3.  In **OneLake data hub** tab, Select the
    **FabricData_Sciencelakehouse** and select **Add**.

      ![](./media/image27.png)

4.  Once a lakehouse is added, it's visible in the lakehouse pane in the
    notebook UI where tables and files stored in the lakehouse can be
    viewed.

     ![](./media/image28.png)

## **Task 5: Ingest data into a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse using Apache Spark**

**Bank churn data**

The dataset contains churn status of 10,000 customers. It also includes
attributes that could impact churn such as:

- Credit score

- Geographical location (Germany, France, Spain)

- Gender (male, female)

- Age

- Tenure (years of being bank's customer)

- Account balance

- Estimated salary

- Number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank

- Credit card status (whether a customer has a credit card or not)

- Active member status (whether an active bank's customer or not)

The dataset also includes columns such as row number, customer ID, and
customer surname that should have no impact on customer's decision to
leave the bank.

The event that defines the customer's churn is the closing of the
customer's bank account. The column exited in the dataset refers to
customer's abandonment. There isn't much context available about these
attributes so you have to proceed without having background information
about the dataset. The aim is to understand how these attributes
contribute to the exited status.

1.  If the imported notebook includes output, select the **Edit** menu,
    then select **Clear all outputs**.

     ![](./media/image28.png)

     ![](./media/image71.png)

16. The data exploration in part 2 showed that out of the 10,000 data
    points corresponding to 10,000 customers, only 2,037 customers
    (around 20%) have left the bank. This indicates that the dataset is
    highly imbalanced. The problem with imbalanced classification is
    that there are too few examples of the minority class for a model to
    effectively learn the decision boundary. SMOTE is the most widely
    used approach to synthesize new samples for the minority class.

17. Select the code cell, replace the existing code with the code below, and click the play button to execute it.
    
    ```
    # If X_train contains categorical columns, encode them first
    X_train_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X_train)
    
    
    # Now, apply SMOTE
    sm = SMOTE(random_state=SEED)
    X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X_train_encoded, y_train)
    
    
    # Combine the resampled data
    new_train = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(X_res), pd.DataFrame(y_res, columns=['target'])], axis=1)

        'Feature3': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
    }
    X_train = pd.DataFrame(data)
    y_train = pd.Series([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])
    
    # Convert necessary columns to numeric to avoid ValueError
    X_train['Feature1'] = pd.to_numeric(X_train['Feature1'], errors='coerce')
    X_train['Feature2'] = pd.to_numeric(X_train['Feature2'], errors='coerce')
    
    # Handle non-numeric columns by encoding them
    X_train['Feature3'] = X_train['Feature3'].astype('category').cat.codes
    
    # Define the random state seed
    SEED = 42
    
    # Apply SMOTE with n_neighbors parameter set to avoid the ValueError
    sm = SMOTE(random_state=SEED, k_neighbors=1)
    X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Combine the resampled data into a new DataFrame
    new_train = pd.concat([X_res, y_res], axis=1)
    
    print(new_train)
    ```

    X_val_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X_val)
    X_res_encoded = pd.get_dummies(X_res)
    
    
    # Ensure X_res_encoded and X_val_encoded have the same columns
    X_val_encoded = X_val_encoded.reindex(columns=X_res_encoded.columns, fill_value=0)
    
    
    # Now execute your code
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name="rfc2_sm") as run:
       rfc2_sm_run_id = run.info.run_id
       print("run_id: {}; status: {}".format(rfc2_sm_run_id, run.info.status))
       rfc2_sm.fit(X_res_encoded, y_res.ravel())
       rfc2_sm.score(X_val_encoded, y_val)
       y_pred = rfc2_sm.predict(X_val_encoded)
       cr_rfc2_sm = classification_report(y_val, y_pred)
       cm_rfc2_sm = confusion_matrix(y_val, y_pred)

## **Task 8: Perform batch scoring and save predictions to a lakehouse**

In this task, you'll learn to import the registered LightGBMClassifier
model that was trained in part 3 using the Microsoft Fabric MLflow model
registry, and perform batch predictions on a test dataset loaded from a
lakehouse.

** **Microsoft Fabric allows you to operationalize machine learning
models with a scalable function called PREDICT, which supports batch
scoring in any compute engine. You can generate batch predictions
directly from a Microsoft Fabric notebook or from a given model's item
page. Learn about [PREDICT](https://aka.ms/fabric-predict).

To generate batch predictions on the test dataset, you'll use version 1
of the trained LightGBM model that demonstrated the best performance
among all trained machine learning models. You'll load the test dataset
into a spark DataFrame and create an MLFlowTransformer object to
generate batch predictions. You can then invoke the PREDICT function
using one of following three ways:

- Transformer API from SynapseML

- Spark SQL API

- PySpark user-defined function (UDF)

1.  Now, click on **FabricData_Sciencelakehouse** on the left-sided
    navigation pane

    cell and click on the play button to execute cell.

     ![](./media/image90.png)

6.  The MLFlowTransformer object is a wrapper around the MLFlow model
    that you registered in Part 3. It allows you to generate batch
    predictions on a given DataFrame. To instantiate the
    MLFlowTransformer object, you'll need to provide the following
    parameters:

- The columns from the test DataFrame that you need as input to the
  model (in this case, you would need all of them).

- A name for the new output column (in this case, predictions).

- The correct model name and model version to generate the predictions
  (in this case, lgbm_sm and version 1).

7.  Select the code cell and click on the play button to execute cell.

     ![](./media/image91.png)

8.  Now that you have the MLFlowTransformer object, you can use it to
    generate batch predictions. Select the code cell and click on the
    play button to execute cell.

      ![](./media/image92.png)

The Power BI report shows:

- Customers who use more than two of the bank products have a higher
  churn rate although few customers had more than two products. The bank
  should collect more data, but also investigate other features
  correlated with more products (see the plot in the bottom left panel).

- Bank customers in Germany have a higher churn rate than in France and
  Spain (see the plot in the bottom right panel), which suggests that an
  investigation into what has encouraged customers to leave could be
  beneficial.

- There are more middle aged customers (between 25-45) and customers
  between 45-60 tend to exit more.

- Finally, customers with lower credit scores would most likely leave
  the bank for other financial institutes. The bank should look into
  ways that encourage customers with lower credit scores and account
  balances to stay with the bank.
