     ![](./media/image19.png)
      ![](./media/image20.png)

6.  Wait for the deployment to complete. It takes 2-3 minutes to
    complete. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty.

## Task 3: Create a lakehouse and upload files

Now that you have a workspace, it’s time to switch to the *Data
science* experience in the portal and create a data lakehouse for the
data files you’re going to analyze.

1.  At the bottom left of the Power BI portal, select the **Power
    BI** icon and switch to the **Data Engineering** experience.

     ![](./media/image21.png)

    **Notebook** under current workspace of **TrainModel_FabricXX.**

     ![](./media/image27.png)

3.  After a few seconds, a new notebook containing a single cell will
    open. Notebooks are made up of one or more cells that can
    contain **code** or **markdown** (formatted text).

      ![](./media/image28.png)

4.  Select the first cell (which is currently a *code* cell), and then
    in the dynamic tool bar at its top-right, use the **M↓** button to
    convert the cell to a *markdown* cell.

      ![](./media/image29.png)
      ![](./media/image30.png)

When the cell changes to a markdown cell, the text it contains is
rendered.

5.  Use the **🖉 (Edit**) button to switch the cell to editing mode, then
    delete the content and enter the following text:

     +++# Train a machine learning model and track with MLflow+++
    
     ![](./media/image31.png)
     ![](./media/image32.png)

## Task 5: Load data into a dataframe

Now you’re ready to run code to get data and train a model. You’ll work
with the [diabetes
dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/open-datasets/dataset-diabetes?tabs=azureml-opendatasets?azure-portal=true) from
the Azure Open Datasets. After loading the data, you’ll convert the data
to a Pandas dataframe: a common structure for working with data in rows
and columns.

1.  In the **Lakehouse explorer** section, select Lakehouses and click
    on the **Add** button under the **Add lakehouse** to add a
    lakehouse.

      ![](./media/image33.png)

      ![](./media/image34.png)

2.  In **Add lakehouse** dialog box, select **Existing lakehouse** radio
    button and select **Add**.

      ![](./media/image35.png)
3.  In **Choose the data you want to connect** page, select your
    lakehouse i.e., **TrainModel_Lakehouse**, then click on the
    **Add** button.
      ![](./media/image36.png)

4.  In your notebook, use the **+ Code** icon below the latest cell
    output to add a new code cell to the notebook.

   **Tip**: To see the **+ Code** icon, move the mouse to just below and
   to the left of the output from the current cell. Alternatively, in the
   menu bar, on the **Edit** tab, select **+ Add code cell**.

5.  Enter the following code in it:
   
      ```
      # Azure storage access info for open dataset diabetes
      blob_account_name = "azureopendatastorage"
      blob_container_name = "mlsamples"
      blob_relative_path = "diabetes"
      blob_sas_token = r"" # Blank since container is Anonymous access
          
      # Set Spark config to access  blob storage
      wasbs_path = f"wasbs://%s@%s.blob.core.windows.net/%s" % (blob_container_name, blob_account_name, blob_relative_path)
      spark.conf.set("fs.azure.sas.%s.%s.blob.core.windows.net" % (blob_container_name, blob_account_name), blob_sas_token)
      print("Remote blob path: " + wasbs_path)
          
      # Spark read parquet, note that it won't load any data yet by now
      df = spark.read.parquet(wasbs_path)
      ```
     ![](./media/image37.png)

6.  Use the **▷ Run cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.
    Alternatively, you can press **SHIFT** + **ENTER** on your keyboard
    to run a cell.

      ![](./media/image38.png)

     **Note**: Since this is the first time you’ve run any Spark code in
     this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the
     first run in the session can take a minute or so to complete.
     Subsequent runs will be quicker.

7.  Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell
    to the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it
    
     ```
     display(df)
     ```
9.  When the cell command has completed, review the output below the
    cell, which should look similar to this:

     ![](./media/image39.png)

    The output shows the rows and columns of the diabetes dataset

10.  The data is loaded as a Spark dataframe. Scikit-learn will expect
    the input dataset to be a Pandas dataframe. Run the code below to
    convert your dataset to a Pandas dataframe:
    
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    df = df.toPandas()
    df.head()
    ```
  ![](./media/image40.png)

## Task 6: Train a machine learning model

Now that you’ve loaded the data, you can use it to train a machine
learning model and predict customer churn. You’ll train a model using
the Scikit-Learn library and track the model with MLflow.

1.  Hover your mouse below the output cell, you’ll see the **+
    Code** icon. Click on the **+ Code** icon and enter the following
    code in the cell. Use the **▷ Run cell** button on the left of the
    cell to run it.
    
    ```
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    
    X, y = df[['AGE','SEX','BMI','BP','S1','S2','S3','S4','S5','S6']].values, df['Y'].values
    
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=0)
    ```
    
     ![](./media/image41.png)

2.  Add another new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code
    in it, and run it:
    
    ```
    import mlflow
    experiment_name = "experiment-diabetes"
    mlflow.set_experiment(experiment_name)
    ```
  ![](./media/image42.png)

The code creates an MLflow experiment named **experiment-diabetes**.
Your models will be tracked in this experiment.

3.  Add another new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code
    in it, and run it.
    ```    
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
        
    with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()
        
       model = LinearRegression()
       model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "LinearRegression")
    ```
     ![](./media/image43.png)

    The code trains a regression model using Linear Regression. Parameters,
    metrics, and artifacts, are automatically logged with MLflow.
    Additionally, you’re logging a parameter called **estimator** with the
    value **LinearRegression**.

4.  Add another new code cell to the notebook, enter the following code
    in it, and run it.
    ```
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
        
    with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.autolog()
        
       model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5) 
       model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
       mlflow.log_param("estimator", "DecisionTreeRegressor")
    ```
    ![](./media/image44.png)

  The code trains a regression model using Decision Tree Regressor.
  Parameters, metrics, and artifacts, are automatically logged with
  MLflow. Additionally, you’re logging a parameter
  called **estimator** with the value **DecisionTreeRegressor**.

## Task 7:Use MLflow to search and view your experiments

When you’ve trained and tracked models with MLflow, you can use the
MLflow library to retrieve your experiments and its details.

1.  To list all experiments, use the following code. Use the **+
    Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell to the
    notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it
    
    ```
    import mlflow
    experiments = mlflow.search_experiments()
    for exp in experiments:
        print(exp.name)
    ```
    ![](./media/image45.png)

2.  To retrieve a specific experiment, you can get it by its name. Use
    the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell to
    the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it
    
    ```
    experiment_name = "experiment-diabetes"
    exp = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name)
    print(exp)
    ```
     ![](./media/image46.png)

5.  Using an experiment name, you can retrieve all jobs of that
    experiment. Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a
    new code cell to the notebook, and enter the following code in it.
    Use the **▷ Run cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.

    ```
    mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id)
    ```
     ![](./media/image47.png)

4.  To more easily compare job runs and outputs, you can configure the
    search to order the results. For example, the following cell orders
    the results by *start_time*, and only shows a maximum of 2 results.

5.  Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell
    to the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.
    
    ```
    mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)
    ```
    
    ![](./media/image48.png)

6.  Finally, you can plot the evaluation metrics of multiple models next
    to each other to easily compare models:

7.  Use the **+ Code** icon below the cell output to add a new code cell
    to the notebook, and enter the following code in it. Use the **▷ Run
    cell** button on the left of the cell to run it.
    
    ```
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       
    df_results = mlflow.search_runs(exp.experiment_id, order_by=["start_time DESC"], max_results=2)[["metrics.training_r2_score", "params.estimator"]]
       
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(df_results["params.estimator"], df_results["metrics.training_r2_score"])
    ax.set_xlabel("Estimator")
    ax.set_ylabel("R2 score")
    ax.set_title("R2 score by Estimator")
    for i, v in enumerate(df_results["metrics.training_r2_score"]):
        ax.text(i, v, str(round(v, 2)), ha='center', va='bottom', fontweight='bold')
    plt.show()
    ```

**Summary**

You’ve created a workspace in Microsoft Fabric with a trial enabled.
Then, you’ve proceeded to set up a data lakehouse, ingested data for
analysis, and created a notebook for interactive coding. You’ve loaded
data into both Pandas and Spark DataFrames, and subsequently trained
machine learning models using Scikit-Learn while tracking their
performance with MLflow. You’ve effectively managed experiments using
MLflow, listing, retrieving, and ordering runs. Additionally, you’ve
explored experiment results in Microsoft Fabric, visualizing and
comparing model accuracy. The best performing model was saved for future
use, and the notebook was appropriately named and saved. Finally, you’ve
completed the lab by cleaning up resources and deleting the workspace
created for the exercise.
